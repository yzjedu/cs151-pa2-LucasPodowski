# Reflection Document

* Full Name :  Lucas Podowski

Objective: Create the game of sticks  
Procedures:
1. Display rules and description of the game
2. Ask for the number of sticks from the user to start with.
3. Ask user how many sticks player 1 and 2 will take
4. Make a turn for the computer.
5. Output final number of losses per player.
* Explored while loops holding a game or program until told to stop  
* I also explored a different way to error check for integers
  
Results: were as expected no test cases  

Reflection:  
* One challenge was error checking. Another was the flowchart. I could not get permission to edit it.
* I first understood the problem in the readme. I then came up with an algorithm. I then tested my algorithm with code.
my algorithm wasn't great so I re-wrote it without functions. I then coded and tested.
* I overcame error checking by learning a different method of try and except for valueerrors. I was unable to complete 
the flowchart.
* A key takeaway I learned was to make better comments and that it is better to make some programs without functions
I also learned how to better use while loops for larger applications
* I think I leaned most of what I should have.
* Working by myself made it quicker to plan and code because I could make a plan myself without needing 
approval from a partner.
